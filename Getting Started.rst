Getting started
===============

Adding it to your project
-------------------------
Method 1: Binaries (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download the latest binaries from `here <https://bintray.com/phault/SwissArmyLib/development/_latestVersion#files>`_ and extract them somewhere in your Unity project's *Assets* folder.

Method 2: Copy source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download the repository and extract it somewhere. 

Then from the extracted folder copy the **Archon.SwissArmyLib** folder into your project **Assets** folder somewhere.

Do the same thing with the **Archon.SwissArmyLib.Editor** folder but place that one in another folder called "Editor".

Start using it
______________
That's it! You can freely start using the library.
Check out the sidebar for some help with using the different utilities.

Building the source
-------------------
Just download the project, open the project in Visual Studio (or use MSBuild via CLI) and build it. There's nothing more to it.
